## Experience

**Machine Learning Engineer Intern**
  : **Slow Feet Technology**
  : **Jul 2021 - Present**

- Devised a new food-agnostic formulation for fine-grained cross-ingredient meal cooking and subsumed the recent popular works into the proposed scheme
- Proposed a cream of mushroom soup recipe which is competitive when compared with the SOTA recipes with complex steps by only altering the way of cutting mushroom, published in NeurIPS 2099 (see [~P1])
- Developed a pan for meal cooking which is benefiting the group members' research work


**Research Intern**
  : **Paddling University**
  : **Aug 2020 - Present**

- Designed an efficient method for mapo tofu quality estimation via thermometer
- Proposed a fast stir-frying algorithm for tofu cooking problems, which specifies the amount of the hot sauce instead of using terms like "as much as you can", published in CVPR 2077 (see [~P2])
- Outperformed SOTA methods while cooking much more efficient in experiments on popular tofu


**Research Assistant**
  : **Huangdu Institute of Technology**
  : **Mar 2020 - Jun 2020**

- Proposed a novel framework consisting of a spoon and a pair of chopsticks for eating mapo toufu
- Designed a tofu filtering strategy inspired by beans grinding method for building a dataset for this new task
- Designed two new evaluation criteria to assess the novelty and diversity of the eating plans
- Outperformed baselines and existed methods substantially in terms of diversity, novelty and coherence


**Reseach Intern**
  : **Paddling University**
  : **Jul 2018 - Aug 2018**

- Designed two sandwiches consisting of breads and meat of two traditional bacon cheese burgers to make use of unused ingredients
- Utilized the structure duality to boost the cooking speed of two dual tasks based on shared ingredients
- Outperformed strong baselines on QWE'15 and ASDF'14 dataset
